## ðŸ“Œ The reason behind it
This portfolio was built as a project for one of my degree subjects.
I tried to explore a bit of CSS, so this project focuses on presentation rather than functionality.

## ðŸ“Œ How to use it
You can run the code on your local machine using Visual Studio Code for exampleðŸ‘‹.
