                <p>Aiming to be a <span>SOFTWARE DEVELOPER</span>, I'm currently focused on gaining
                    and improving skils and exchanging experiences.<br>
                    I enjoy reading and trying on new recipes from time to time, as much as I enjoy travelling
                    and getting to know new places and people.
